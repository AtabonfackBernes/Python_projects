# 🎯 Beginner Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of simple Python projects I worked on as a beginner to practice basic programming concepts like conditionals, loops, user input, string formatting, and logic building.

## 📜 List of Projects

### 1. 🎲 Guess the Number

A simple number guessing game where:
- The player chooses a maximum range.
- The computer randomly selects a number within that range.
- The player keeps guessing until they get it right.

**Concepts practiced:** Loops, conditional statements, user input, random number generation.

### 2. 📝 Madlib Generator

A fun Madlib-style sentence generator where:
- The user fills in personal details like name, institution, GPA, and field of study.
- The program outputs a short story/introduction using the information provided.

**Concepts practiced:** String formatting (f-strings), user input.

### 3. ✊✋✌️ Rock, Paper, Scissors

A basic implementation of the classic game:

### 4. 🪓 Hangman Game

A more advanced word-guessing game where:
- The computer randomly chooses a word.
- The user guesses letters with a limited number of lives.
- The game continues until the word is guessed or the user runs out of lives.

**Concepts practiced:** Sets, loops, string manipulation, user input, file import, game logic.

> Note: The `words.py` file should contain a list of words (e.g., `words = ["python", "code", "developer", ...]`)
